         <div class="text1"><p>As an 8-year-old kid, I trained basketball for 3 months in the basketball club "Mecina" in Kraljevo. When my family and I moved to Belgrade I started training rowing at rowing club "Partizan". I trained rowing for 6 years and I competed at numerous domestic and international races in which I won around 40 medals. My greatest achievements in rowing are:<br><li> 6x international champion, 4x vice-champion </li><li> 4x state champion, 2x state vice-champion</li><li>   2x competitor at the "Balkan rowing championship" (Istanbul-Turkey and Kastoria-Greece)     </li><li>2x indoor rowing champion</li></p><p><br>  Rowing has had a big part in forming my personality, especially teaching me how to be disciplined in every possible situation. Rowing is a cruel and ruthless sport that does not forgive any mistakes. I quitted rowing in 2019, because I realized  I had to devote more time learning math for the entrance exam. In my opinion, education will always be more valuable than sport. </p>  
             <div class="text2"><p>The day after I quit rowing, I went to a nearby gym named "Muscle factory gym" and I have been training actively ever since. In my gym training I try to combine multiple different sports such as bodybuilding, powerlifting, calisthenics, CrossFit, running and boxing.</p></div>

                  <div class="text3" ><p> My great passion except gym is basketball, which I  like to play whenever I can. I am truly dedicated to a healthy lifestyle and I am learning something new every day about training and nutrition. My goal is to train smart while also consuming at least 80% of my daily calorie intake from healthy food. Usually, diets are stressful for uneducated people with their strict food plans that can create huge mental problems. That kind of lifesyle can cause, for instance, anorexia, bulimia, etc. To avoid those health problems, we need to find a perfect balance between healthy and unhealthy nutrients.</p></div>
