         <div class="text1"><p>Mindset is the most important part of the personality and that is a place where the difference is made between people. The best mindsets are created in terrible situations, for example, poverty, loss of a close member of the family, huge disappointment etc. Point is that we cannot have healthy and righteous mindsets if we haven't passed some bad situations in life. A famous quote will best describe this: "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger" and I will add "and makes you better". In the previous 4 years, I have changed my personality a lot. Credits go to my family, best friend Marko and to the books. Believe it or not books had a huge impact on my personality, especially book written by Mark Manson named "Subtle art of not giving a fuck". Lessons that I learned from that book and life are:</p><br>
         <ul>
             
             <li>Always give your best to improve your personality</li>
             <li>   Don't give a fuck about stupid things, only for important things such as family</li>
               <li> 
Listen to the advice that important people are saying  </li>
               <li>  
Honesty is the most important part of every relationship </li>
               <li>***<u>Don't do things to someone else that you don't want others to do to you </u>***</li>
               <li> Don't try to be someone else, just be the best version of yourself  </li>
               <li> One little decision can have a huge impact on your life ("the Butterfly effect")  </li>
               <li> It is normal to be hated by people if you are more successfull in every aspect of life </li>
               <li>

Don't let emotions control your behavior, always listen to your mind and be patient when deciding
                </li><br>
